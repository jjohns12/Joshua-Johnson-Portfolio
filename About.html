<h1> My Story </h1>


<div id="bio"><p> My name is Joshua Johnson and I currently am a high school social studies teacher at <a href="https://www.wbsd.org/westbloomfieldhs"
        target="_blank">West Bloomfield High School</a>. 
I have been in education for the past
eight years and I still have the same passion for learning as when I first entered the field. 
 With that being said, the future of education will be driven by technology. 
 I want to be a part of this revolution and I think diving into the world of coding will provide 
me with the skills and training necessary to do so. 
Not only will it allow me to expand my ability to maximize learning outocmes, 
 but it will put me in a position to leverage these skills beyond public education as well. </p>

        <div id="personal"><p> Outside of my professional life, I am a family-oriented man with a passion for <a href=

                target="_blank">Brazilian jiu-jitsu</a> 
                , hip-hop, 
                sports, and politics. Most recently, I was lucky enough to marry my college sweetheart in the summer of 2015 and we currently 
                reside in the Metro Detroit area. Outside of debating politics and watching a good movie, we love spending time with our family and 
                friends. We have a passion for life and enjoy taking advantage of the various sights and surroundings the Metro-Detroit area has to 
                offer. </p>
